        <p>
            Hi! My name is Sara Shee, and I have always been passionate about music. My musical journey began when I started playing the piano at the age of five, continuing until the 8th grade. In addition to piano, I also sang from 3rd to 6th grade, which helped me develop a love for vocal music. However, the instrument I have stuck with the longest is the flute, which I have been playing since 3rd grade and continue to play today. In 10th grade, I also picked up the piccolo, adding a new layer to my musical experience.
            Throughout the years, I’ve competed in several music competitions. I was thrilled to place 3rd in a piano competition when I was in 4th grade. For the flute, I earned 2nd place in a competition in 7th grade and achieved 1st place when I was in the 10th grade. 
            Additionally, I’ve been part of both the general and select orchestras at school, performing multiple flute solos and one piccolo solo.
Outside of performing, I love listening to music. Some of my favorite artists include Ken Carson, Lana Del Rey, Travis Scott, Playboi Carti, and Fisher. Music is a huge part of my life!
            This website is a space where I can share my thoughts, projects, and everything related to music!
